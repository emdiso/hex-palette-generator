# Hex Palette Generator

## Description

The hex-palette generator is a proof of concept website created as a school project. 
The project was oriented around UI/UX, so the functionalities of the website are not fully implemented. 

This website is created using HTML/JavaScript/CSS and a Flask backend. 

The landing page of this website is a mocked page that is just meant to show what the feed would look like, if developed further.
It shows palettes created by fake users, and when you click on the palettes, CSS code will be saved to your clipboard. 

The main feature of the website allows you to upload your own image, and the app will choose 6 random (but predominant) colors from the image, creating a hex color palette.

You can save your custom palette, which will be saved to a SQLite database, and show up on your profile page. 
Just like the landing page, you can copy the CSS code for your palette to your clipboard.
